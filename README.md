## About Me and the Application

Thank you for checking out my very first coding project! My biggest take away from this project was the compartmentalization of the process, defining each play, they played a crucial role in planning out the structure of this application. Throughout the process, I referenced many sources of information to familiarize myself with language functions and syntax, best practices for programming, and in order to troubleshoot errors and code bugs. These sources include language documentation, error logging, Google Chrome's Developer Tools, external blogs and internet resources, as well as discussing issues with colleges.
